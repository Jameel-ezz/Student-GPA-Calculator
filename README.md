#This code is a Python script that calculates a student's semester grade point average (GPA). It consists of two functions: calculate_grade and calculate_gpa.

#The calculate_grade function takes a numerical grade as an input and returns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on the grade input. It also calculates a weighted #grade by dividing the grade by 20 and subtracting 1.

#The calculate_gpa function takes two lists as inputs: a list of grades and a list of credit hours for each course. It uses the calculate_grade function to determine #the letter grade and quality points for each course. It then calculates the total quality points and total credit hours and returns the semester GPA by dividing the #total quality points by the total credit hours.

#The script tests the calculate_gpa function with a list of grades and a list of credit hours, and prints the calculated semester GPA.
